# Bayesian nonparametric clustering model

This is a test bench for an implementation of a clustering model that determines the adequate complexity, the number of mixture components, from data by using a variational inference algorithm.

### Usage
Run the module `bnp_clustering.py` as script or use it interactively. The module `generatedata.py` is used for sampling.
